# Robot Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning with computer vision for planning the robot grasp - Master thesis -  Djordje Panin 2021

Here I am presenting my master thesis - it's a work in field of Robotics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning:

-Unity simulation environment for training reinforcement model 
 
-Computer vision algorithm for acquisition of environment(positional information about objects in the work field).
     Python Code developed with OpenCV library. This application
     communicate directly with Unity HMI application and send positions of objects.
     This code I run on Raspberry Pi computer with Pi Camera.
 
-Instruction code for Denso robot. In this case robotic arm controller code is 
     a client and execute command from python server application (Socket communication)
 
-Main script where is a training mode(additional simullation enviroment without 3d represenation),
 
-Unity application that represent HMI with graphical commands for moving object
